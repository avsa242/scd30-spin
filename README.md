# scd30-spin 
------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the Sensirion SCD30 CO2 sensor.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.


## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 100kHz (P2, or P1 with PASM engine), or ~30kHz (P1, SPIN engine)
    (*max recommended according to Sensirion is 50kHz*)
* Read CO2, Temperature, RH data (IEEE-754 float, or hundredths of unit integer)
* Set measurement interval in seconds
* Sensor data-ready status
* Read sensor firmware version
* Soft-reset
* Set altitude or ambient pressure used to compensate CO2 readings
* Automatic or manual calibration


## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine (none if the SPIN I2C engine is used)
* sensor.temp.common.spinh (source: spin-standard-library)
* sensor.rh.common.spinh (source: spin-standard-library)
* sensor.co2.common.spinh (source: spin-standard-library)


P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library
* sensor.temp.common.spin2h (source: p2-spin-standard-library)
* sensor.rh.common.spin2h (source: p2-spin-standard-library)
* sensor.co2.common.spin2h (source: p2-spin-standard-library)


## Compiler Compatibility

| Processor | Language | Compiler               | Backend      | Status                |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| P1        | SPIN1    | FlexSpin (6.9.4)       | Bytecode     | OK                    |
| P1        | SPIN1    | FlexSpin (6.9.4)       | Native/PASM  | OK                    |
| P2        | SPIN2    | FlexSpin (6.9.4)       | NuCode       | OK                    |
| P2        | SPIN2    | FlexSpin (6.9.4)       | Native/PASM2 | OK                    |

(other versions or toolchains not listed are __not supported__, and _may or may not_ work)


## Limitations

* Requires a build-time change of behavior to the I2C engine (symbol `QUIRK_SCD30` is automatically
enabled by the driver at build-time)
